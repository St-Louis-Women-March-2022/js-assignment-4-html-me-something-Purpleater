               <h1>Humble Beginnings</h1>
               <p>
                  Imagine you're me, in early March of 2022, watching a popular "The Binding of Issac" youtuber (otherwise known as <a href ='https://www.youtube.com/c/Sinvicta'>Sinvicta</a>). You finish watching all of the daily runs,
                  when suddenly you're afflicted with a sudden bout of boredom. Not knowing what to do otherwise, you click onto the main part of the youtube channel and find a playlist titled "Lobotomy Corporation".
                  You've heard of the game in the past, and lightly considered looking into it, however you never followed through with it. <br><br>
                  
                  
                  That is, until now...

                  <h1>Lobotomy Corporation - The Catalyst</h1>
                  <img src="images\lob corp Header.jpg", alt="If you're reading this, Angela is lying." width="400" height = "200">
               <h2>The Game:</h2>
               <p>
                  Lobotomy Corporation is, in Project Moon's words: <blockquote>"A roguelite monster-management simulation inspired by the likes of the SCP Foundation"</blockquote>
               In other words - you are a person managing a facility that contains and studies a wide-array of monsters (otherwise dubbed Abnormalities) in order to obtain information and extract energy from them. 
               Sometimes, however, the monsters don't like how you're interacting with them. And when that happens, there are a multitude of things that can happen: Sometimes nothing happens,
               sometimes the associated abnormality escapes, sometimes the abnormality escapes and kills several employees, sometimes they do something else altogether. Ultimately, 
               it is up to you as the manager to uncover information in regards to the abnormalities in your facility. Will you pull through and successfully manage the facility, 
               or will you be forced to sit and watch as your employees are mass-murdered by a literal censor bar?
               </p>
               <p>
                  Another element of Lobotomy Corporation that is regularily adored by the fans is the story. Many of the abnormalities contains layers of information within their files.
                  Some may be as simple as the managerial tips that will aid one in dealing with the abnormality, however others contain detailed backstories that are simultaneously utilized
                  as metaphors throughout the extent of Project Moon's worldbuilding. <br><br>

                  And there there is the "Funny Rainbow People" (as dubbed by a particular Flight Rising user)â€”<br>

               </p>
               <p>
                  These guys are otherwise known as the Sephirah of the facility. They are AI designed to serve as an extension of you as a manager; they manage the individual departments
                  that make up the facility. Each individual Sepiroth is associated with a different department, and all of them have their own personalities.<br><br>

                  They are also as mentally/emotionally stable as me being kept away from sugar for two weeks straight. <br><br>

                  Have fun.
               </p>

               <h2>My Experience:</h2>
               <p>
                  It was Lobotomy Corporation that dragged me into Project Moon's worldbuilding. I initially picked up the game due to the beforementioned monster managment gameplay,
                  however I eventually found myself looking into the story as well. One of the biggest elements of the game itself is the fear of the unknown about selecting a new
                  abnormality, and then picking an agent to send in with the hopes that the abnormality won't breach after work is performed. That, or minding your own business
                  and seeing that one of the worst abnormalities in the facility has escaped for reasons you would only discover much later on. I personally regret not going into this
                  game blind, and I recommend that anyone looking to pick up the game ought to try and go into it with as little information as possible.

            <h1>Library of Ruina - The Spiral</h1>
            <img src = "images\library of ruina title art.jpg", alt="POV Roland is a beanpole." width="400" height ="200">
            <h2>The Game:</h2>
            <p>

               Library of Ruina is a card deckbuilder that takes place after the events of Lobotomy Corporation (more specifically, the true ending). Most of the game takes place in "The Library",
               which is a large structure that mysteriously appeared after the events of Lobotomy Corporation. Run by a superintelligent (yet also emotionally stunted) AI, the Library's purpose
               is to host a series of events called "Receptions", to which guests are invited to the Library and pitted in a series of battles within in exchange for valueble information. If they win, they
               get to take the books that were promised on the invitation; if they die, they are turned into a book themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
               The main plot of the story follows two characters: Angela (the beforementioned AI running the library), and a man named Roland (Your average, Grade 9 Fixer). Over the course of the story,
               both individuals are forced into situations where they must confront aspects of their personality that would have significantly influenced their present-day desires. Whether it's Angela,
               and her trauma over the events that transpired during Lobotomy Corporation, or Roland, who has seen all of the horrors Project Moon's dystopian City has to offer, the events that transpired
               in the Library became the catalyst that allowed them to confront their pasts and become better individuals.

            <h3>Meet Roland, your average, Grade 9 Fixer</h3>

            <h2>My Experience:</h2>
            
            <p>
               Normally, I'm not too over the top when it comes to many things that I do, however I can genuinely say that this game is probably in my "Favorite Video Games List of All Time"
               I remember picking up this game after having some fun with Lobotomy Corporation and being absolutely captivated by it. Ever since that has occured, my life has gone downhill
               in the best way possible. I have carpet-bombed people's entire DMs with Library of Ruina/Lobotomy Corporation memes; and as far as I can tell, there have been minimal signs of 
               life within those DMs ever since such actions have transpired. 
            </p>
            <p>
               That aside, Library of Ruina took the very mild interest that I had for Lobotomy Corporation's cast of characters and cranked my adoration for them up to an eleven. I'm
               normally never one to get too attached to characters (I don't know why, however I've just never been one to do that kind of stuff), however if anyone in the sephira cast were
               to perish, I will punt everyone in the room and then myself in a whirlwind of sadness and rage.

         <p>
            Not gonna lie, I hyperfixated on this assignment a little too much. Even up to the point where I forgot that there were actual requirements. That being said,
            I hope you enjoy this little green paragraph all the way down here. Anyways, please play these wonderful games I have so many Project Moon-related memes that I want
            to send to people and yet I have nobody to send them to.
